# Document Classification using NLP, Machine Learning
## Objective
Performed document classification into four defined categories (World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech). Trained the classifier accuracy with different models ranging from Na√Øve Bayes to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and RCNN and compared the accuracy. By making use of different feature engineering techniques and Natural Language Processing (NLP) features created an accurate text classifier.


## Tech Stack
- Language- Python
- Libraries- Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit Learn, NLTK, Keras, TensorFlow backend
- Models- Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Shallow Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network, RCNN
